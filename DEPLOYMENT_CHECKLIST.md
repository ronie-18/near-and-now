# 🚀 Deployment Checklist for nearandnow.in

## The Problem
You're seeing "Loading Near & Now" on production but the app works fine on localhost.

**Root Cause:** The production server has OLD cached code that hasn't been updated yet.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Deploy Latest Code to cPanel

Go to **cPanel** → **Git Version Control**:
1. Find your repository
2. Click **"Update from Remote"** 
3. Click **"Pull or Deploy"**
4. **WAIT** until you see "Deployment complete" or similar message
5. Verify the timestamp shows the current time

### 2. Verify Files Were Actually Deployed

In cPanel **File Manager** → `public_html/`:
- Check if `index.html` size is **~1.72 KB** (not the old size)
- Check if `assets/index-CuwbFBlC.js` exists (new filename)
- Delete old JavaScript files if they exist:
  - `assets/index-DKi8Y4Ak.js`
  - `assets/index-CCHoZQZf.js`
  - `assets/index-BBBwqo4r.js`

### 3. Clear ALL Caches

**Browser Cache (CRITICAL!):**
- Windows: Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` → Select "Cached images and files" → Clear
- Mac: Press `Cmd + Shift + Delete` → Select "Cached images and files" → Clear
- **OR** use Incognito/Private browsing mode

**Server Cache (if using CloudFlare/cPanel Cache):**
- If you have CloudFlare: Go to CloudFlare dashboard → Purge Cache
- If you have cPanel cache: Go to cPanel → Clear Cache

### 4. Test the Site

Visit: `https://nearandnow.in`

**Open Browser Console (F12) and look for these logs:**
```
🌐 HTML loaded successfully
📍 Page URL: https://nearandnow.in
🚀 [MAIN.TSX] Script loaded
✅ [MAIN.TSX] Root element found
✅ [MAIN.TSX] React render called
✅ [APP.TSX] App component rendering
✅ [APP.TSX] App mounted successfully
```

### 5. Troubleshooting Based on Console Output

**If you see NO logs at all:**
- JavaScript file isn't loading
- Check Network tab (F12 → Network) for failed requests
- Verify file permissions in cPanel (files: 644, folders: 755)

**If you see "HTML loaded" but nothing else:**
- JavaScript file path is wrong
- Check if `assets/index-CuwbFBlC.js` exists in `public_html/assets/`

**If you see errors in red:**
- Copy the EXACT error message
- Share it so we can fix the specific issue

**If you STILL see "Loading Near & Now":**
- You're viewing cached content
- Clear browser cache more aggressively:
  - Close all browser tabs
  - Clear cache completely
  - Restart browser
  - Try different browser

## 🆘 If Nothing Works

1. Take a screenshot of:
   - Browser console (F12 → Console tab)
   - Network tab showing all requests
   - cPanel file manager showing `public_html/` contents

2. Check these specific things:
   - Is the file `public_html/index.html` actually updated? (check file modification date)
   - Does `public_html/assets/` folder contain the new JavaScript file?
   - Are you accessing the correct domain (not a cached CDN URL)?

## 🎯 Quick Test

Visit this test URL to verify React is working:
```
https://nearandnow.in/test
```

If this shows "✅ React App is Working!" then React is fine and the issue is with the home page component specifically.
