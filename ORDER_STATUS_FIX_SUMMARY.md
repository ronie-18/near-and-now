# Order Status Update Fix - Summary

## Problem
When trying to update order status in the admin dashboard, the error "An error occurred while updating the order status" was displayed. The root cause was a **database constraint violation**.

## Root Cause
The Supabase database has a CHECK constraint on the `orders.order_status` column that only allows specific values:

### ✅ Allowed Statuses:
- `placed`
- `confirmed`
- `delivered`
- `cancelled`

### ❌ NOT Allowed (causing errors):
- `processing`
- `shipped`
- `pending`

The application code was trying to use `processing` and `shipped` statuses, which violated the database constraint.

## Changes Made

### 1. **adminService.ts**
- Updated `Order` interface to use only allowed statuses:
  ```typescript
  order_status: 'placed' | 'confirmed' | 'delivered' | 'cancelled';
  ```
- Updated `getDashboardStats()` to:
  - Count `placed` and `confirmed` orders together as "processing" for display
  - Set `shippedOrders` to 0 (not a valid status)

### 2. **admin/OrdersPage.tsx**
- Updated status dropdown to show only allowed options:
  - Placed
  - Confirmed
  - Delivered
  - Cancelled
- Updated status filtering and statistics to use correct values
- Updated color coding:
  - `placed` → Blue
  - `confirmed` → Orange
  - `delivered` → Green
  - `cancelled` → Red

### 3. **AdminDashboardPage.tsx**
- Updated order status display to use correct values
- Updated icon mapping for each status

## Status Mapping for Display

The UI displays "Processing" but internally it represents orders with either:
- `placed` status (newly placed orders)
- `confirmed` status (confirmed/being processed orders)

This provides a better user experience while respecting the database constraints.

## Testing Results

✅ Order status updates now work correctly
✅ Dashboard statistics display accurate data
✅ All status transitions work without errors:
- placed → confirmed ✓
- confirmed → delivered ✓
- any status → cancelled ✓
