CRITICAL MISSING FEATURES
-------------------------

1. ORDER CREATION & PERSISTENCE
   Priority: CRITICAL
   Status: Not implemented

   Problem:
   - Checkout page only simulates order placement
   - Orders are NOT saved to database
   - No way to track actual orders

   Impact:
   - Users can't see their order history
   - Admin can't manage real orders
   - No order tracking possible

   Solution Needed:
   - Create createOrder() function in src/services/supabase.ts
   - Update CheckoutPage.tsx to save orders
   - Pass real order ID to ThankYouPage


2. ORDERS PAGE - REAL DATA
   Priority: CRITICAL
   Status: Using mock data

   Problem:
   - OrdersPage shows hardcoded mock orders
   - Doesn't fetch from database
   - Users can't see their actual orders

   Solution Needed:
   - Create getUserOrders(userId) function
   - Update OrdersPage to fetch real data
   - Filter orders by authenticated user


3. THANK YOU PAGE - REAL ORDER DETAILS
   Priority: HIGH
   Status: Using random order ID

   Problem:
   - Generates fake order ID
   - Doesn't show actual order details
   - No connection to real order

   Solution Needed:
   - Pass order data from CheckoutPage
   - Display real order information
   - Show order items and totals


IMPORTANT MISSING FEATURES
--------------------------

4. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES TEMPLATE
   Priority: COMPLETE
   Status: .env.example exists

   Current State:
   - .env.example file exists in root directory
   - Contains all required environment variables
   - Users can reference it for setup
   - File is filtered by .cursorignore (normal for .env files)


5. NEWSLETTER SUBSCRIPTION
   Priority: MEDIUM
   Status: TODO comment exists

   Problem:
   - Footer has newsletter form but doesn't work
   - TODO comment in code: // TODO: Implement actual newsletter subscription logic

   Solution Needed:
   - Create newsletter_subscriptions table in Supabase
   - Implement subscription API call
   - Add success/error notifications


6. WISHLIST FEATURE
   Priority: LOW
   Status: Not implemented

   Problem:
   - Mentioned in PROJECT_SUMMARY.md but not built
   - No way for users to save favorite products

   Solution Needed:
   - Create wishlist table or use user metadata
   - Add "Add to Wishlist" functionality
   - Create WishlistPage
   - Add wishlist icon to header

- wishlist or user metadata - For wishlist feature


QUICK ACTION ITEMS
------------------

[ ] Create createOrder() function
[ ] Update CheckoutPage to save orders
[ ] Create getUserOrders() function
[ ] Update OrdersPage to use real data
[ ] Update ThankYouPage to show real order
[X] .env.example file exists
[ ] Implement newsletter subscription

DOCUMENTATION STATUS
--------------------

- README.md - Project overview
- SETUP.md - Setup instructions
- PROJECT_SUMMARY.md - What's been done
- BUG_FIXES.md - Bug fix log

NOTES
-----

- The project is in a good state with most core features working
- The main blocker is order creation/persistence
- Once orders are working, the app will be functionally complete for MVP
- All other features are enhancements that can be added incrementally
