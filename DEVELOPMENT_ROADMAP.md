## 📝 Notes for Developers

1. **Component Implementation**: Start by implementing the basic structure of components, then add functionality.
2. **State Management**: Use React Context for global state, and local state for component-specific state.
3. **API Integration**: Use custom hooks to abstract API calls and manage loading/error states.
4. **Styling Approach**: Use Tailwind utility classes directly in components, extract common patterns to custom classes if needed.
5. **Testing Strategy**: Write tests alongside component development, not as an afterthought.

## 🚀 Getting Started for New Developers

1. Review the project structure in `GETTING_STARTED.md`
2. Check the current implementation status in this roadmap
3. Pick an unimplemented component or feature to work on
4. Create a branch for your feature
5. Implement the feature following the project's patterns
6. Submit a pull request for review
